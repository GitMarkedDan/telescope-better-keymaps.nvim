# telescope-better-keymaps
A simple plugin for NeoVim that mimics Telescope's default keymaps picker, but comes with a few quality of life features, such as:

1. Including default keymaps
2. Simplifying any keymaps that use <Plug> (assuming that the definition for said <Plug> keymap can be found)
3. Merges data from Lazy.nvim
4. (TODO) Optionally displays the keymaps for default motions

# Installation
